This project was made for "coding_challenge-30 --- PongPongPong (using JavaScript or Python)" of ZTM.
Using Ricardo Milos materials is only for entertainment purpose with all due respect and the identity of Ricardo as a well-beloved character on the Internet,
one of my personal favorite too.

Hope everyone enjoys this mini game I created.
Have fun!
